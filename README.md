# dog-cat-classifier-CNN
I developed a classifier for distinguishing between images of dogs and cats using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained on a diverse dataset, leveraging convolutional layers to extract features and fully connected layers for classification. With techniques like dropout and batch normalization, the classifier achieved high accuracy and robust performance on unseen data.
